I'm coding a Memory Game that display the time you're taking to finish the game. My code provided is just a more basic template of the feature I use, but it's a fairly similar use case.

What Do I need?

Display the formatted time on my html since you started a click interaction represented here by the startChrono() function.
Automatically stop the time if you're not interacting for a period of time OR if the game is finished.
Automatically resume the time if you interact again.
resetting the time completely in the code and the DOM.
